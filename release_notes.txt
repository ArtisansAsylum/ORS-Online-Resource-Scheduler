Changes:
Version 3.8.1
* Added "Sent from scheduling system at..." footer to e-mails sent by scheduler
   (so users know where it came from)
* re-fix changes associated several features (see below). These changes had 
   been in the 3.7 beta but got lost in the 3.8 merge.
* Fix bugs in Daylight Savings Time (caused duplicate dates to appear in 
   calendar)
* Fix display bugs in days without signups
* Fix use of usleep on windows platforms (don't - use loop)
* Fix display on signups which don't end at a time-block transition

Version 3.8
* Switched to use of $_SERVER and $_ENV instead of $HTTP_zzz_VARS
* Removed some uses of Globals (now only used if available - will speed up some 
   operations but not necessary)
* Updated license for new version #
* PHP 5.x compatibility changes. 
* Changed all $HTTP_POST_VARS and $HTTP_GET_VARS to be $_POST and $_GET
* Fix for DST bug
* Add footer on messages (sent from scheduler)
* Changed to use usleep instead of loop
* Fix to allow short time period (<30 minutes) intervals
* Fix for 5.0 which assures empty start or end times are considered zero and do not give warnings
